    Use the dropdown menu below to explore each hypothesis in detail,

        ### **Summary of Findings**
        The hypotheses were validated using statistical methods
         and visualizations.
        All four hypotheses were confirmed to be correct:
        - Larger houses, higher quality, newer construction, and
         the presence of garages
          are all strongly associated with higher sale prices.
        - These findings align with **Business Requirement 1** and
         provide actionable
          insights for feature engineering and predictive modeling.
